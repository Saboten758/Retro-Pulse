# Retro Pulse

Well, I was trying out react-native-sensors, react-native-track-player and a bunch of other libraries, for getting the real-time (kinda...) sensor data from my phone and playing music. This repository contains an app built with React Native.

## Features

- Utilizes accelerometer, magnetometer, gyroscope and light sensors.
- Displays real-time sensor data.
- Simple UI, with a retro look.
- Additional device info with all system features listed.
- Automatic flashlight in the dark (only on devices with a light sensor).
- Current Location data.
- Simple music player with Nightwave Plaza radio and other radios like J1 FM
- Uses OpenWeather API to fetch location based weather data.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Saboten758/Retro-Pulse.git
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Retro-Pulse
3. Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
4. #### Create a file in the 'screens' directory and create a 'env.tsx' file and type:
    ```bash
    export  const OpenWeatherAPi=[YOUR API KEY]
4. Run the project:
    ```bash
    npm start
This will start the Metro bundler and launch the project on an emulator or connected device.
